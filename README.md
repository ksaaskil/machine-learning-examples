# Machine learning examples and tutorials

## Getting started
- Install Python >= 3.5.0 using, e.g., [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) as instructed [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac)
- Install the required libraries listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) (the list may not be exhaustive)
- Some of the libraries are optional:
  - [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/) is required for saving Keras models
  - [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.0.0/index.html#) is required for image classification examples
- Open `.ipynb` files in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/index.html)
- Some datasets like [cats-vs-dogs image classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) require registering at [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/)
